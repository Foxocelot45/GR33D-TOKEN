## Proposal Process

### 1. Proposal Submission
```javascript
Requirements:
{
    minimumStake: "25,000 GR33D",
    lockPeriod: "3 months",
    proposalElements: {
        title: "String",
        description: "String",
        technicalSpecification: "Optional",
        implementation: "Required for technical proposals",
        timeline: "Required",
        budget: "If applicable"
    }
}
```

### 2. Review Period
- Duration: 72 hours
- Community discussion
- Technical review
- Impact assessment
- Feedback integration

### 3. Voting Phase
- Duration: 7 days
- Quorum requirement: 10% of total staked tokens
- Victory threshold: 66% majority
- Emergency proposals: 3-day voting period

### 4. Implementation
- 48-hour timelock for standard proposals
- 24-hour timelock for emergency proposals
- Technical verification
- Community notification
- Execution monitoring

## Voting Mechanism

### Vote Types
```solidity
enum VoteType {
    For,
    Against,
    Abstain
}

struct Vote {
    address voter;
    uint256 weight;
    VoteType voteType;
    uint256 timestamp;
}
```

### Vote Weight Calculation
```solidity
function calculateVoteWeight(address voter) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 stakedAmount = getStakedAmount(voter);
    uint256 lockDuration = getLockDuration(voter);
    require(stakedAmount >= 5000 * 10**18, "Insufficient stake");
    require(lockDuration >= 90 days, "Insufficient lock period");
    
    // Base voting power = 1 token = 1 vote
    uint256 voteWeight = stakedAmount;
    
    // Cap at 5% of total voting power
    uint256 maxWeight = (totalStaked * 5) / 100;
    return min(voteWeight, maxWeight);
}
```

### Voting Contract Security
- Multi-signature requirement for critical functions
- Timelock on implementations
- Vote delegation controls
- Anti-flash loan protection
- Replay attack prevention

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Structure
```solidity
contract GR33DDAO {
    // Governance parameters
    uint256 public constant MIN_VOTE_STAKE = 5000 * 10**18;  // 5,000 GR33D
    uint256 public constant MIN_PROPOSAL_STAKE = 25000 * 10**18;  // 25,000 GR33D
    uint256 public constant MIN_LOCK_PERIOD = 90 days;  // 3 months
    uint256 public constant VOTE_DURATION = 7 days;
    uint256 public constant PROPOSAL_COOLDOWN = 14 days;
    
    // Governance state
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastProposalTime;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public proposalExecuted;
}
```

### Proposal Lifecycle
```solidity
enum ProposalState {
    Pending,
    Active,
    Canceled,
    Defeated,
    Succeeded,
    Queued,
    Executed,
    Expired
}
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Actions
1. Critical vulnerability fixes
2. Protocol parameter adjustments
3. Emergency pauses
4. Fund protection measures

### Emergency Response
- 24-hour voting period
- 80% majority required
- Immediate implementation
- No timelock for critical fixes

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Governance Metrics
- Proposal success rate
- Voter participation
- Token distribution
- Stake duration
- Implementation effectiveness

### Reporting
- Weekly governance summary
- Monthly analytics
- Quarterly performance review
- Annual governance report

- Analytics dashboard

## Future Development

### Q1 2025 Enhancements
- Advanced voting mechanisms
- Enhanced analytics
- Mobile voting interface
- Automated execution
- Cross-chain governance

### Planned Features

## Important Notes
1. All stake and lock requirements are immutable
2. Voting power is proportional to staked amount
3. Lock period must be maintained throughout voting
