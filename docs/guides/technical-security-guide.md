## Smart Contract Security Features

### Core Protection Mechanisms

#### Transaction Security
```solidity
// Anti-Bot Protection
uint256 public constant MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_TXS = 20;  // 20 seconds

// Transaction Limits
uint256 public constant STANDARD_TX_LIMIT = 15_000 * 10**18;
uint256 public constant STAKING_TX_LIMIT = 50_000 * 10**18;
uint256 public constant MAX_WALLET = 100_000 * 10**18;  // 2% of supply
```

#### Access Control
- UUPS Upgradeable Pattern
- Multi-signature requirements for critical functions
- Role-based access control
- Emergency pause functionality
- Time-locked operations

#### Anti-Manipulation
- ReentrancyGuard on all critical functions
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Flash loan protection
- Price impact limits
- Slippage controls

### Real-Time Monitoring System

#### Transaction Monitoring
- Gas usage tracking
- Failed transaction alerts
- Large transfer notifications
- Unusual pattern detection
- Wallet concentration monitoring

#### Contract Health
- Balance monitoring
- Event logging
- Function call frequency
- Error rate tracking
- Gas optimization metrics

## Emergency Response Procedures

- Major functionality failures
Response Time: < 5 minutes

## Incident Response Protocol

### 1. Initial Assessment
```
□ Identify issue severity
□ Document incident details
□ Notify relevant team members
□ Begin response timeline
□ Secure affected systems
```

### 2. Immediate Actions
```
□ Emergency pause if necessary
□ Notify key stakeholders
□ Contact emergency response team
□ Document all actions taken
□ Prepare community announcement
```

### 3. Resolution Process
```
□ Implement fix/patch
□ Test solution thoroughly
□ Deploy updates
□ Verify functionality
□ Monitor for side effects
```

### 4. Post-Incident
```
□ Complete incident report
□ Review security measures
□ Update documentation
□ Implement preventive measures
□ Community debrief
```

## Security Best Practices

### Contract Interaction
- Always use approved interfaces
- Verify contract addresses
- Check transaction parameters
- Monitor gas prices
- Review function permissions

### Wallet Security
- Multi-signature requirement
- Hardware wallet usage
- Regular security audits
- Access control reviews
- Backup procedures

### Development Guidelines
```solidity
// Always include
require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
require(amount <= maxAmount, "Exceeds limit");
require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "Too early");
```

## Audit & Compliance

### Smart Contract Audits
- Regular code reviews
- External audits
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability assessments
- Compliance checks

### Monitoring Tools
- Ethereum network monitoring
- Contract event tracking
- Transaction analysis
- Gas usage optimization
- Performance metrics

## Emergency Procedures

### Contract Pause
```solidity
function emergencyPause() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
    emit SystemPaused(block.timestamp);
    
    // Notify emergency contact immediately
    // https://t.me/GreedyFoxxx
}
```

### Fund Recovery
```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw() external onlyOwner whenPaused {
    require(block.timestamp > emergencyTimeout, "Wait for timeout");
    // Recovery logic
}
```
